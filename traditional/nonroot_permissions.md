# Granting write permission of files and directories to nonroot users

The product installer can create a group for users who are authorized to create profiles or give individual users the authority to create profiles.

Nonroot users create their own profiles to manage their own environments. Typically, they manage environments for development purposes.

Nonroot users must store their profiles in their private directory structure, not in the _/opt/ibm/BPM/v24.0/profiles_ directory of the product.
